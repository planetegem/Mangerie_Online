Because I didn't like the obstacle of having to download Mangerie, I created this online version. Works on mobile and desktop. Images were generated by AI (Dall-e 3, Bing Image Creator), while sound effects come from freesound.org (credits for each specific audio file in modules/SoundLinbrary.ts).

You can easily add your images and stories to the kaleidosocope by manipulating the modules/PictureBook.ts file: the kaleidoscope expects a pictureBook constant which is an array of objects. Each object needs to have the following properties:
1) desc = the description which appears when loading the image in the kaleidoscope
2) src = url to the image you'll be using
3) img = a new Image() object (used when loading)
